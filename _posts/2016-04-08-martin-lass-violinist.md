Forget 2Cellos, The Piano Guys, David Garrett, Andre Rieu, and Lindsay Stirling... well before them, _**Martin Lass**_ had
already broken the mold of the usual violin soloist, crossing over from a classical
background into his ancestral [gypsy music][0], [rocked-up Bach][1], and [breathtaking original
compositions][2].

He won the
Australian "Mo Award" for Instrumental Excellence seven times in a row, was
awarded the "Australian Variety Club Showman of the Year," has performed alongside the likes of Julio
Iglesias and Luciano Pavarotti, and has performed in three British Royal Command Galas.

As a recording artist, Martin has a Gold Album,
an Australian "Grammy" nomination, and has charted No. 13 on the American NAV
charts with his latest CD, "[Sonnet][3]."
